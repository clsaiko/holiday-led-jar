# holiday-led-jar
Version 2 of holiday-light-jar, using Arduino and LED strips.

Based off of a previous version.

Since deciding to move from a PIC microcontroller to some flavor of STM32, I'm refining this project with an Arduino Nano, using the previous version as an inspiration. It will be a little heavier on the power requirements, but this should do well as a second version.
